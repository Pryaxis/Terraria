# terraria
The unofficial Terraria issue tracker.

This is a repo used as an issue tracker for the game Terraria. The purpose is to allow community members to report bugs and issues that exist in Terraria that aren't specific to mods like Open Terraria API, tModLoader, and TShock.

Anyone can create an issue, as long as the issue is about Terraria.
